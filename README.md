# ROAD ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS (POWER BI)

## INTRODUCTION 
>This project analyze key indicators and create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 and the sample data are from United Kingdom. 
This project is designed to provide profound insights into road safety, driving meaningful change and enhancing public safety through comprehensive metrics.

## REQUIREMENT / KPI's THAT NEED TO SOLVE
* Total Casualties and Total Accident Values for Year 2022 and YoY growth
* Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Year 2022 and YoY growth
* Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Year 2022 
* Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Year 2022 and Previous Year
* Casualties by Road Type for Year 2022 
* Year 2022 Casualties by Area/ Location & Day/ Night
* Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
> The goal of this project is to make an dashboard showing the past data to provide insights into road safety to help some stakeholders that needed this dashboard in order for them to come up and implement posible solutions.

### DATA CLEANING
 *  When the data was on MS Excel, duplicates data were deleted 
 *  I used TRANSFORM DATA option and used REPLACED VALUE since the data had some wrong spelling.

## ANALYSIS 
### Total Casualties and Total Accident Values:
The decrease in both casualties and accidents in the year 2022 compared to the previous year is a positive sign for road safety.
This indicates that the implemented safety measures or changes in road infrastructure may be having a positive impact on reducing accidents and casualties.
### Casualties by Accident Severity:
A decrease in casualties across all severity levels (fatal, serious, slight) is a positive outcome, demonstrating that efforts to reduce the severity of accidents are effective.
### Casualties with Respect to Vehicle Type:
The decrease in casualties by vehicle type suggests that vehicle safety standards and awareness campaigns may be yielding positive results. 
### Monthly Trend of Casualties:
The declining trend in casualties throughout the year is a promising sign, indicating that road safety measures have been consistent and successful.
